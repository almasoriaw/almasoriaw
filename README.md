# 👋 Hello, I'm Alma Soria!

📊 Machine Learning Analyst Student | Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect | 🌦 DevOps Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about exploring technology, especially Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing (both Architecting & DevOps).

I'm captivated by ML and AI because their developmental stages mirror the growth of human cognition. Reinforcement Learning reminds me that, like machines, we can learn and grow through experience and feedback. Also, I love and find fascinating DevOps not just for its technical impact, but also for its philosophical reminder: continuous integration and improvement aren’t just for software, they’re essential for becoming better versions of ourselves iteration by iteration.

I'm currently pursuing a Machine Learning Analyst Diploma and always learning on my free time about cloud technologies and data analytics.

## 🔧 My Skills & Interests:
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **DevOps Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, Vagrant, Maven, Jenkins
- **Data & Machine Learning:** Python, SQL, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (very basic knowledge)

## 🌟 Some Projects:

### 📊 Predicting Efficiency & Downtime on Industrial Fluid Operations  
  
**Tools**: Python, Dash, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, Plotly, statsmodels, Jupyter, Git, HTML/CSS

- Developed predictive ML models to quantify efficiency and downtime across fuel transaction types using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and a custom PyTorch neural network (R² = 0.98). (Likely overfitting, but this is part of my learning curve =), so I own this!)
- Engineered 30+ features from ~1M transactions and weather logs, including temperature bins, flow rate targets, and seasonal product sensitivity.  
- Conducted hypothesis testing (ANOVA, t-tests) and SHAP interpretability to uncover seasonal-product interactions and key environmental drivers (temp, pressure, humidity).  
- Deployed a local app and interactive dashboard (Dash, Plotly, Flask) and integrated **MLflow** tracking for versioning and auditability.

### 🌱 NPRI: Predictive Modeling of Industrial Pollutant Releases  

**Tools**: Python (pandas, geopandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, scipy), Time Series Analysis

- Cleaned and transformed 700K+ environmental records from Canada’s **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)**.  
- Resolved complex location issues using reverse geocoding to infer missing city data, with fallbacks to provincial capitals.  
- Engineered time-series features to model 5-year emission growth/decline trends across industries.  
- Built and evaluated Random Forest and Linear Regression models (R², MAE, MSE) with residual diagnostics.  
- Visualized pollutant trends, residuals, and geographic emission patterns for interpretability and validation.

### 📷 Almagram App – High-Availability Instagram Clone on AWS  

**Tools**: AWS, CloudFormation, CI/CD, EC2, RDS, CloudWatch

- Designed and deployed a scalable, Instagram-like app using **Infrastructure as Code** (CloudFormation).  
- Implemented **Auto Scaling** EC2 instances and **RDS** for reliable, scalable database backends.  
- Built a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing and deployment, enhancing system uptime.  
- Integrated **CloudWatch** for real-time logging, health monitoring, and alerting.  
- Secured the environment using **IAM roles**, **VPC**, and **security groups**.

## 📚 Certifications:
- AI Programming with Python – **Udacity AWS AI & ML Scholarship Recipient**  
- Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect - Dec. 2024 - Dec 2026

## ✨ Fun Facts:
- I’m originally from **Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico**, and I’m now a **Canadian citizen**. 🇲🇽 → 🇨🇦  
- My personality type is **INFJ-T (Advocate)**, and I love helping others while solving complex problems!  
- I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Biopharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of Guadalajara. Since my degree isn’t recognized in Canada, I decided to shift into computer science, applying my analytical skills to build a new career in tech.

### 🤖 A Dear Reminder

**Use AI as you wish to be treated.**  
Let’s make this a guiding principle in our tech community — to build and use AI **with care, for good, and for the greater good.**

As Immanuel Kant taught:  
> “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”

Let’s treat AI not just as a tool, but as a reflection of our ethics —  
shaping technology that uplifts, empowers, and respects humanity.
